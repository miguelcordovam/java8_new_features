Software evolution is about understanding
how our codebases grow. It turns out that codebases
 evolve according to certain patterns. Some of them are good,
  while some patterns indicate serious maintainability problems
  . My approach is to analyze the history of our codebase. Once
  we embrace the past, we get a lot of useful information. Itâ€™s
  information that lets us uncover productivity bottlenecks, parts
   that are hard to maintain, and even parts at risk for defects in
    our codebases.
